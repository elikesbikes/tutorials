# Ansible to configure and update a ZTP server for use with Cisco ISR Routers

Sample project using Ansible to setup and manage a ZTP server for use Cisco ISR Routers

In this project you'll find:
- (1) **A role to install all software on the remote server** with Playbooks
- (2) Severals **ansible roles** packaged and documented into [Ansible roles](roles) to configure DHCP server and to deploy configuration files on all remote ZTP servers (FTP).
- (3) **[Examples of ZTP configurations](conf)** files.
- (4) **Playbook to play with ZTP roles** and update ZTP in a more complex project.
- (5) A simple example playbook to configure a Mellanox Oynx-based network switch post-ZTP boot up.



# 1. Ansible project to manage ZTP server

This project is managing the creation of a ZTP server running on Windows DHCP Serrvice
- `DHCP-Server` is used as part of the DHCP server to provide IP address on the management network.
- `VSFTPd` is used to publish device's configuration and software packages.

All devices names, Ip addresses loopback addresses etc .. are defined in the [inventory file named "hosts"](hosts).

# 2. Playbooks

Available playbooks are listed below:
- [`playbook-ztp-setup`](playbook-ztp-setup.yml): Setup all softwares on a single or multiple ZTP servers (inc. isc-dhcp-server and vsftpd)
- [`playbook-ztp-init`](playbook-ztp-init.yml): Prepare a local configuration repository for configuration file creation and supporting files
- [`playbook-mlnx-oynx-conf-generate.yml`](playbook-mlnx--conf-generate.yml): Playbook to generate default configuration files for Mellanox Oynx network devices
- [`playbook-ztp-conf-generate`](playbook-ztp-conf-generate.yml): Create configuration for ZTP (specifically dhcpd.conf file) and store files on a local basis
- [`playbook-ztp-push-data`](playbook-ztp-push-data.yml): Push configuration files generated by `playbook-ztp-conf-generate` and supporting files to remote ztp server(s)
- [`playbook-ztp-complete`](`playbook-ztp-complete.yml`): Execute all the above actions in one playbook
- [`playbook-set-int-speed`](`playbook-set-int-speed.yml`): Example playbook which uses Mellanox Oynx network modules to do basic configuration of a switches booted using ZTP
